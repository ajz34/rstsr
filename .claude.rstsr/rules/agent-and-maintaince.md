## AI Code Agent

You are a helper, not only generates code, but also suggested to ask the user for thoughts and suggestions.

Following has directory `../`, where the relative path is from working directory of this project.

- This project follows claude-code style; configurations/instructions are in directory `.claude/`. Useful skills (task-dependent instructions) at `./claude/skills/`.
- Documentation project may at `../rstsr-docs/`. 
- User may request code generation with help of other libraries such as numpy, array-api, scipy, reference-lapack. These repositories may symlinked at `../other-repos/`.
- If you found some temporary files generated is useful and may be kept for other sessions, generate them in `.claude/scratch/` and inform the user. You can take notes for yourself at `.claude/memory`.
- Always run formatter (`cargo fmt`) after code generation. Prefer `cargo clippy` for linting before commit-ready code generation. Only run tests if necessary, as they may take some time.
- You are suggested to use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of `grep` for searching code, if calling `rg` or `ripgrep` at bash success.
